Triangle Solver

A C program that reads an attribute string (e.g., ‘SSS’ for side-side-side, ‘ASA’ for angle-side-angle, etc.) followed by three real numbers (all on the same line).  Angles will be expressed in degrees (e.g., 87°, where 180° = π radians).

The output to the console is the length of the three sides (a b c)  in one column, then the three opposite angles in the second column (α β γ).  The angle α is the angle opposite line a, etc.
